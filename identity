# -- Overview --

# Per-account and per-user stuff goes in this file.  This particular instance
# will hold details for several gmail accounts, as well as facilities to switch
# among accounts quickly.

# Gmail is assumed.

# The password manager "pass" is assumed, along with some password paths.

# Mutt configuration does not seem to allow declaration of new variables, but
# respects environmental variables.  If you see a variable used that was never
# set, that's why.  The wrapper script for mutt included in this repo should
# contain those definitions.

# Set the folder inside the folder-hook.  It won't cause a loop, and it will
# cause '=' to represent the current folder.  (I would expect a loop as
# setting the folder would trigger the folder-hook again.  I would also
# expect '=' to be set when the change-folder action occurs.)
