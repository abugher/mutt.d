# Set an account hook so that whenever mutt interacts with the imap server, it
# carries out the "subtract" macro.  Ultimately, I'll only want to maintain one
# or the other of these, so I'm just going to duplicate the whole wad here for
# testing.  If this works, I won't need to whack the minus key to get rid of
# these messages.
